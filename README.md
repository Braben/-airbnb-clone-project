Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Understanding design properties in Figma (like color, font, and spacing) ensures that:

Your web app looks consistent across all pages.
It helps frontend developers follow the same design system.
It makes collaboration between designers and developers easier.
You can create reusable components that match the mockup perfectly.
